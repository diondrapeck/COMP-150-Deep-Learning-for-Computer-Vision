# COMP-150-Deep-Learning-for-Computer-Vision
First three problem (of four) problem sets for Tufts University's COMP 150: Deep Learning for Computer Vision. 

I am completing these independently in preparation for a summer internship with Microsoft Research (Artificial Intelligence). 
The course is taught by one of my mentors for the summer, Dr. Genevieve Patterson, and it covers linear classification and neural networks
(CNNs, recurrent NNs), and neural network visualization. The official course page is here: https://comp150dl.github.io/
