# COMP-150-Deep-Learning-for-Computer-Vision
First three (of four) problem sets for Tufts University's COMP 150: Deep Learning for Computer Vision which is based on Stanford's CS231n: Convolutional Neural Networks for Visual Recognition.

I am completing these independently in preparation for a summer internship with Microsoft Research (Artificial Intelligence Group). 
The course is taught by one of my mentors for the summer, Dr. Genevieve Patterson, and it covers linear classification and neural networks
(CNNs, recurrent NNs), and neural network visualization. The official course page can be found here: https://comp150dl.github.io/
